# CISC3130LAB5
This repo contains the assignment due on November 8th 2020 which is the Lab 5 for CISC3130 for Professor Katherine Chuang. The repo contains two folders with two files each, the Java Code Files and the Output files. The Java Code files contains two files, Lab5.java which is the main code and class of Song.java which contained the getters and setters for song along with the constructor for song. Lab5.java creates a Binary Search Tree(BST) that compares the ASCII values of song name strings to organize the tree. Traversal of the tree occurs in inorder traversal and sets it in the tree. Like previous labs we would split the line for each line of the CSV file by commas and set them to variables and use that to create our song which contained the title, artist and the stream count. Afterwards we use an insert method to create our tree and repeat for each line of the CSV file. We then print the tree out to "TopStreamingArtists.txt" and we create our own subsets printing to "subsets.txt" which are both in output files in the repo.
